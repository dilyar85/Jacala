# Introduction
Jacala is a simple programming language similar to other modern languages. It is developed and encapsulated in Scala. It supports following features:  
- Arithmetic, logic, and declarations, typed in single line or blocks 
- Execution of loops, lambda expressions, and recursive functions
- Variable assignment, object construction, and dereferencing
- Eager execution, lazy execution, and dynamic type checking

## How to run it
Make sure you have `sbt` on your machine. If not, you can install it shown as below:  
```
$ brew update
$ brew install scala
$ brew install sbt
```

Under the `Jacala` project path, run it using `sbt`    
```
$ sbt 
$ run
```

If you typed everything correctly, you would see `Running system.console` on your terminal
